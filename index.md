# Petr Motejlek
## What I Am Offering
- 15+ years of experience spanning software development for a plethora of platforms, network administration and maintenance, full stack web development, single machine setups as well as clusters. I also have experience talking to customers, and am able to proficiently understand their problems and propose appropriate solutions.  
- Very quick learner, preferring diving deep, rather than superficial understanding.
- Knowledge about multiple different programming languages and paradigms (currently, my favorites are TypeScript, OOO TDD and DDD with a sprinkle of functional programming).
- I truly enjoy this field, and always do my best to get better at it.
- Live in Prague, Czech Republic.

## What I Am Looking For
- Agile, open, transparent and trusting environment where teams are empowered to come up with solutions to problems on their own. No long-winded requirement specification or design documents written by "somebody else" for the teams to "implement without thinking".
- Prefer software over hardware.
- Prefer working on/with web and media technologies, or related.

## I Enjoy Doing, Know About and Am Highly Motivated By
- Automation and clouds, with continuous integration and deployment - I want us to deploy our software ourselves (DevOps is a must).
- TypeScript, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Ansible, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Scrum, AWS, Azure, Git, and more.
- Iterative development with short release cycles.
- Typing the code (hence TypeScript).
- Clean code, clean architecture.

- Transparency and openness.
- Sharing what I know with others.
- Learning more and more.
- Working as a team, rather than an individual or a group of individuals. Pair and/or mob programming.
- Drive for continuously inspecting and adapting on all levels of the organization.
- Flat organization with high-performing teams organized around projects with full support, responsibility and accountability.
- I prefer face to face conversations, however understand that right now, that's not really possible.

- Able to work as a leader (experience with managing people, being a Product Owner and Scrum Master), however prefers being a highly engaged member of a development team.

- Like to travel.

## I Dislike and Get Demotivated By
- Organizational politics.
- Complex organizational ladders and hierarchy.
- Thinking of people as “resources” and thinking they can deliver the best output when working on more than one project.
- People's reluctance to continuously improve.
- Repetitive manual tasks and outgrown historical systems.
- Incremental (waterfall) development with long release cycles.
- Waste, both physical (unnecessary paper overuse), as well as process.

## Professional History
- Too much to all fit here. There's a lot I know already, and what I don't know, am always willing to learn, if it helps us grow and deliver better solutions.
- For those who care, there is a list of random keywords at the bottom.
